description=a list of two numbers will set the new thresholds. "reset" will reset the detection algorithm to a clean state by opening both gates. "dead" will set the duration of a dead period during which the threshold detection doesn't register new events after an event was detected. When the dead period has passed, belated events get reported. Default is a dead period of 0
