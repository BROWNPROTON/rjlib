description=Chord names based on the "Dictionary of Intervals and Chords" by Benjamin K. Shisler online at: http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Studios/9783/ci1.html (good ol' geocities.com ...) These names were used because they are all at least one character long and don't contain spaces nor special characters.
