[patch]
name=m_ms2sm
description=m_ms2sm converts duration in milliseconds to a duration in samples using either Pd's samplerate to calculate the conversion or a manually specified samplerate in Hz. In resampled subpatches, the subpatch samplerate is used as default, which may be up- or downsampled with a [block~] object.

[argument 0]
domain=float
description=float to set samplerate in Hz to use. Optional, default is Pd's samplerate as reported by the [samplerate~] object.

[inlet 0]
domain=float
description=duration in millisecond to convert

[inlet 1]
domain=float
description=set samplerate in Hz to use. A value of 0 is filtered out and will instead activate the system's sample rate as reported by the samplerate~ object.
