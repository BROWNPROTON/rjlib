[patch]
name=u_samplekit2
description=Loads a directory of stereo samples (a "kit") into numbered tables. The lookup by number will report the base name of the two tables of a stereo file. The samplekit must have a text file mapping sample names to numbers. The default name of this file is "index.txt", but you can overwrite the name inside the "open" message. After a kit was loaded you can look up the actual table names by sending a number to the [u_samplekit2]'s first inlet. It will then send out the matching table name to its first outlet. The full names are generated by appending "-1" for the left and "-2" for the right channel.
