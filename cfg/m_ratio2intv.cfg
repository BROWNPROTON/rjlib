description=Convert a frequency ratio into a pitch interval. Pitches are in "midi pitch" units: 1 equals a half tone step. For example to convert a frequency ratio of 2 (one octave up) would result in a pitch interval of 12 have tones (one octave). Based on an object from Karl-Heinz Essls "RTC-lib".
