description=Calls a user-defined operation for each of the incoming list's items and returns a list of the return values. u_listmap is a helper abstraction to make element-wise operations on lists easy to patch. The basic idea is to bundle a list-serializer and a list-repacker into one object. Then you connect whatever operation should be applied on every list item to the right outlet and send the modified items back to the right inlet. Here the modified elements get packed into a list again and sent to the left outlet of u_listmap.
