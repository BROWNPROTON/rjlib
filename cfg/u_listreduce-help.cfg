description=Returns a single value constructed by calling the user-defined objects connected to the right outlet on the first two items of the sequence, then on the result (if it comes in through the right inlet) and the next item of the original list, and so on. If nothing is connected to the right inlet, [u_listreduce] will act like the left and right outlets of [list split 2] reversed. Only one element can be sent back into Inlet 1
