name=m_markovanal
description=m_markovanal analyses a stream of number pairs and maps them to histograms describing how often a certain number followed another number. It's intended to be used in a first order markov chain like the [c_markov] object offers. You can directly connect the outlet or [m_markovanal] to the probability inlet of [c_markov] and then "dump" the histogramm lists into it.

[outlet 0]
domain=list
description=lists describing a histogram. Each histogram starts with a number between 0 and the maximum as specified by the object argument minus one, that then is followed by <max> numbers, which indicate, how often the respective position was seen following the first number in the past. You can directly connect this outlet to [c_markov].
