name=s_loopsmooth
description=s_loopsmooth internally uses s_playolap to play parts of a table as loops. You can smoothly change the loop duration and the starting point. Loop duration has a lower border of 10 msec. Transposition in semitones can be issued with the "transposition" message. Each chunk is enveloped with a half cosine wave and 50% out of phase from the other. Use "sr" messages to specify the samplerate of the soundfile you want to use.All parameter changes are "sample-and-held", so you won't get clicks when scratching around in the sample, but a side effect is a latency of duration "chunk-size".
