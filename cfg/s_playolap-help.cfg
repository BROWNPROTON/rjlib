[patch]
name=s_playolap
description=s_playolap plays two alternating, overlapped chunks of a table, that have a size specified with the "chunk-size" inlet1-message and is transposed by halftones set with the "transposition" message. Each chunk is enveloped with a half cosine wave and 50% out of phase from the other. The signal coming into the first inlet sets the read position in the table. Use "sr" messages to specify the samplerate of the soundfile you want to use.All parameter changes are "sample-and-held", so you won't get clicks when scratching around in the sample, but a side effect is a latency of duration "chunk-size".
