[patch]
name=u_messagesaver
description=u_messagesaver can be used to collect the settings of most rj-objects into a message box. To use it to save an object tagged with e.g. "TAG" create a u_messagesaver with the name of the abstraction to save and the "TAG" as first and second argument, and connect a message box to its outlet. Then just send a bang to the u_messagesaver's inlet to have it set the message box content to the latest settings. If there is more than one object tagged with the same tag, settings will occur duplicated as many times. u_messagesaver will only save objects that use the u_dispatch/ u_loader mechanism provided in the rj library.
