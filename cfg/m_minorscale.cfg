name=m_minorscale
description=m_minorscale lets you play one of three minor scales by sending scale steps. The base note of the scale can be set with an argument or with the second inlet. Minor scales come in three tastes: natural is just the diatonic major scale shifted 3 steps down ("aeolian"), harmonic minor is the same with a raised 7th step and melodic minor additionally has the 6th scale step raised. Often the alternate minor types are only used for ascending melodies. You can turn on or off a special automatic mode with "auto 0/1" which will then compare the current step with the previous step and select the natural minor scale for descending intervals, and the mode set with "mode" before for ascending intervals.
