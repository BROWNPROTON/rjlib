name=u_robinpoly
description=Helper to automatically create copies of an abstraction and schedule them in a round robin fashion. Round robin polyphony is useful when you want a fixed number of voices and only steal the oldest voice automatically. This is typically the case for drum sounds or one-shot-samples. For piano-like instruments u_makepoly is better. The instruments to make polyphonc should have two inlets and one outlet~. Up to 4 arguments can be passed as arguments to the instrument. You should use a declaration like [declare -path .] in your Scene's "_main.pd" to let u_robinpolymono find your instruments there.
